# Final-Year-Project
This is David's Pearcy 3rd Year Project was about ray tracing on CPU and st very slow frame-rate. 

The Code Was good a soild 2nd when marked in December 2018 but as my report was rushed I finshed a 3rd.
The .Cpp and .H files are all bar two is made by me, That one being Veator3.h and.cpp mostly made by graphics lecturer and then changed by me. 
their is a video on my website that shows the ray tracer working and I explain why it takes so long to render.
